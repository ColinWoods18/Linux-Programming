					Homework 6 Pseudocode

First, parse through the user's arguments looking for a '-' character to symbolize that a command will be the next character or characters. 

If the dash is not found, print an error message about needing to have command input. 

If the dash is found process the following characters. If both an 'x' and a 'c' are present, print an error message telling the user that they cannot create and extract and archive. Set booleans for these commands and use them to process further actions.

If no argument was found after an 'f' command, print an error telling the user that they must specify a file name.

If no commands were found, print an error message to the user telling them they must select a command to use the utility.

If the command was a 'c' and not a 'x', then start from the argument after 'f' and open an archive file to write the information. From there process the next arguments and store them in the archive until there are not arguments left to be processed.

If the command was an 'x', extract the archive of the name which was the first argument following the 'f' command. 

Once all commands and arguments are processed, return 0 and end the program.

Make sure to print appropriate error messages as the code progresses, consider all use cases and output errors for bad uses or code occurences.
